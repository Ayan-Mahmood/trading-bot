# trading-bot
Trading bot project I made to see if I can get rich easily! (I did not get rich)

Explored financial strategies and combined it with computer science for a fun passion project. First using RSI as the indicator for trading, but after unsuccessful backtesting I tried other strategies. I then used an LSTM model because I am interested in AI and I wanted to see how that would go. Then after some more unsuccessful backtesting I tried one other strategy. I used a linear regression model with the MACD indicator which also was not performing well in backtesting. By unsuccessful backtesting I mean it was not horrible with win-rates ranging from 50 to 65 percent, but to me that is not good enough to put real money on the line.
