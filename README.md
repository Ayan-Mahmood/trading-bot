Algorithmic Trading Bot project I made to see if I can get rich easily! (I did not get rich). If only it were that easy...

Explored financial strategies and combined it with computer science for a fun passion project. First using RSI as the indicator for trading, but after backtesting I saw poor performance so I tried other strategies. I then used an LSTM model because I am interested in AI/machine learning and I wanted to see how that would go. The LSTM strategy worked decently but I felt it could have been improved. I then added some features and improved the trading mechanics for the LSTM model, which had a 2.09 Sharpe ratio after backtesting. Then I researched a lot online and tried other strategies like Mean Reversion and Momentum Trading, but those did not perform too well in backtesting. I then used a linear regression model with the MACD indicator which also was not performing well in backtesting. I think that I would not want to put real money on the line, but it was fun to research strategies and try to code great strategies. It is also very dependent on what stock or commodity was chosen, in all cases I used QQQ to backtest my models/strategies.
